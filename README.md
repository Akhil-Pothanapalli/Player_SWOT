I support RCB in IPL. It is well known fact that they never won any IPL title by the time of writing this.

They often fail in the pressure situations and knock out matches. 

I feel like if I can create a model that when given both teams as input, will generate the SWOT analysis and one can prepare according to it.

There are several inputs to be taken and I feel like this is a great start to my learning journey.

There are several steps in building a production grade end-to-end model
1. Data Collection
2. Preprocessing and preparing your data
3. selecting the right machine learning model
4. Training your machine learning model
5. Evaluating model performance
6. Tuning and Optimizing your model
7. Deploying the model and making predictions

Let's start with Data Collection. The Data sources should be defined. In my opnion there are two kinds of data. 
1. The enermous stats that every one is familiar with and these are even displayed in the matches itself
2. The subjective aspect - being the commentery.

The number are very useful. But they never capture the complete picture. So it is wise to add one more dimension to it.
The commentery capture these details like the field placement, the strong and weak zones of the cricketer. The mental attitude to it. 

But stats are structured and commentery isn't. So the best way is to create a model is using neural networks. But let's not jump ahead of steps.

Let us start with Data Collection.
